Linux Post Installation Script. Saves you a lot of time and energy by automating the process to install the most commonly used tools after a fresh install of Linux (Any debian based distro). 


If you are new to Linux or you have just a developer and reinstalled your OS, just like me who likes to re-install the OS every few months, this script is for you. Every 3 to 4 months I re-install the OS and I have to install the most commonly used tools again and the system as they don't come pre installed in most of the Linu distros. Sometimes I forget what tools I was using before. And even I remember all those names, I have to install those one by one by entering commands, waiting for that command to finish, and again entering anoother command. I am a lazy person so I created this script to automate the whole process. Because it's a very tedious job to to visit different websites, downodload the .deb files or search for their installation method because all the tools are not available in apt repositories.

This script was tested on Ubuntu 20.04.3 but hopefully will work on all the debian based distros which use APT package manager. Al the tools installed by the script are listed below.
